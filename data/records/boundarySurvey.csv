","In these images, it was easiest to identify color boundaries when the two colors near one another contrasted more, for example the stark line between the cobalt blue and the sky blue in image A. In these images I found myself not considering a color boundary as where two colors almost mixed but more when there was a distinct line between the two colors.

Black, dark gray, gray, and then more of a white color.","In A, it was less clear for me where the color boundary was between the light blue and dark blue. From the blue to green, green to yellow, and then orange to red it was more clear. In B and C, it seemed much more clear to me where the boundary is. Dark blue to the start of the light blue, then green, then orange, and then red.",IM_8plD4oKUVFqX2Yd,"I specialized the categories from that dark purplish/black color to the start of the blue, then green, then yellow, and then the last brightish white color.","This one was more difficult.

With image B, the boundaries of color between light and dark were harder to distinguish as I looked closer toward to center. Image C seemed to provide the best difference between light and dark as the color boundaries seemed to be much more apparent.","The color boundaries in image A were very similar to those in image B in that the colors seemed to fade into one another. Image C seemed to have a greater level of demarcation of where green ended and blue began, for example.",IM_8plD4oKUVFqX2Yd,"Image A seemed to have fairly good level of demarcation as far as where black ended and blue began, for example. Image B was very similar to image A in that one color didn't blend too much into another. It was pretty clear to me what boundary was where for image C due to the brightness of the colors used.","As with the other schemes, I saw in image A a sort of line that became the middle point for each color portion as it separated from another portion. Image B was very similar to this but somehow it seemed like the boundary lines were more noticable. Compared to other image types found in image C, this color scheme seemed to blend together a bit more at the color boundaries but with this image I felt like I had a pretty good idea as to where the color boundary lie.",IM_0wDHFgSj2HjEFSZ,No,Male,34,Yes,42,5

USually that happened when there was a transition in color or light to dark or vice versa,I personally noticed that there were certian colors that always look like they had harsh boundaries. One of them was yellow the other was light blue.,IM_dmqzlZWGwVQwPzv,Like I said previously I usually saw boundaries when it went from dark to light so on b I see a bundary between the green and dark blue.  same with C.

Instead I simply started at the lightest color I could find and then worked backwards.  I looked for colors that seemed darker than the last color I had looked at and that is how I could distinguish color boundaries. ,"First I looked for the traditional rainbow colors (red, orange, yellow, etc.) and then based off of those basic colors I searched for different shades of that color in order to decide on where the color boundaries were.  ",IM_8plD4oKUVFqX2Yd,Because these were not colors that are commonly seen blended together I simply looked for differences in color.  In some ways I found it easier to distinguish between these color boundaries than when all the colors of the rainbow were displayed. ,First I distinguished the most obvious color changes that were brightest and easiest to see.
