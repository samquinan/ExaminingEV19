[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/samquinan/RCM-Analysis/master?filepath=AnalysisOverview.ipynb)

This repository contains the requisite support files for a jupyter notebook with code for various static and interactive plots used to analyze the results of the study presented in 'Examining Explicit Discretization in Spectral Schemes'. The discussions of these plots are located in the paper and supplemental appendices.
